# Weather App Project
This Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the weather conditions for a specific location. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for and press the "Search" button.
4. Wait for a moment, and the app will display the current weather conditions for the specified city.
